   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following variables:
   ```env
   # Database
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/sweetshop
   # or for MongoDB Atlas:
   # MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/sweetshop

   # JWT Configuration
   ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_access_token_secret_here
   ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY=1d
   REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=your_refresh_token_secret_here
   REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY=10d

   # Cloudinary Configuration
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret

   # Server Configuration
   PORT=8000
   CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The backend server will start on `http://localhost:8000`

5. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to frontend directory**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Configuration**
   Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory:
   ```env
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The frontend application will start on `http://localhost:5173`

5. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

6. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

### Running the Complete Application

1. **Start MongoDB** (if running locally)
2. **Start the backend server** in one terminal:
   ```bash
   cd backend && npm run dev
   ```
3. **Start the frontend server** in another terminal:
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm run dev
   ```
4. **Access the application** at `http://localhost:5173`

## ü§ñ My AI Usage

Throughout the development of this Sweet Shop Management System, I leveraged several AI tools to enhance productivity and code quality:

### AI Tools Used:
- **ChatGPT (OpenAI)** - Primary AI assistant for code generation and problem-solving
- **Claude (Anthropic)** - Secondary AI tool for code review and optimization
- **Gemini (Google)** - Used for brainstorming and architectural decisions

### How I Used AI:

#### 1. **Test Generation** üß™
- **Primary Use**: I used ChatGPT and Claude extensively for generating unit tests and integration tests
- **Specific Examples**:
  - Generated Jest test cases for backend controllers and services
  - Created React Testing Library tests for frontend components
  - Helped with mock function concepts, which I was still learning
- **Impact**: AI significantly accelerated my testing workflow since I was new to mocking concepts and test patterns

#### 2. **Frontend HTML & CSS Development** üé®
- **Primary Use**: Used all three AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) for UI/UX design and styling
- **Specific Examples**:
  - Generated Tailwind CSS classes for responsive layouts
  - Created component structures and styling patterns
  - Helped with React component architecture and best practices
- **Reason**: I'm not particularly interested in UI design, so AI helped me create professional-looking interfaces quickly

#### 3. **Bug Fixing & Debugging** üêõ
- **Limited Use**: Used AI minimally for debugging, primarily for understanding error messages
- **Specific Examples**:
  - Helped identify issues with JWT token handling
  - Assisted with CORS configuration problems
  - Provided insights on MongoDB connection issues
- **Approach**: I preferred to debug most issues myself but used AI as a second opinion

### Reflection on AI Impact:

**Positive Impacts:**
- **Learning Acceleration**: AI helped me understand testing concepts, especially mocking, much faster than traditional learning methods
- **Productivity Boost**: Significantly reduced time spent on repetitive tasks like writing boilerplate tests and styling components
- **Code Quality**: AI suggestions often included best practices I might have missed
- **Confidence Building**: Having AI as a coding partner made me more confident to experiment with new patterns

**Challenges & Limitations:**
- **Over-reliance Risk**: Had to be careful not to become too dependent on AI for problem-solving
- **Code Understanding**: Made sure to understand every piece of AI-generated code before implementing
- **Context Awareness**: AI sometimes provided generic solutions that needed customization for my specific use case

**Key Learning:**
AI tools were most valuable for tasks I was less experienced with (testing, UI design) and least necessary for core logic where I had strong fundamentals. The combination of AI assistance with personal code review created an effective development workflow.
